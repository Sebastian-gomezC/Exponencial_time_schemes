abstract = {The need to evaluate a function f(A) ∈ ℂn×n of a matrix A ∈ ℂn×n arises in a wide and growing number of applications, ranging from the numerical solution of differential equations to measures of the complexity of networks. We give a survey of numerical methods for evaluating matrix functions, along with a brief treatment of the underlying theory and a description of two recent applications. The survey is organized by classes of methods, which are broadly those based on similarity transformations, those employing approximation by polynomial or rational functions, and matrix iterations. Computation of the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivative, which is important for condition number estimation, is also treated, along with the problem of computing f(A)b without computing f(A). A summary of available software completes the survey. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

@article{Brachet2022,
abstract = {The time integration scheme is probably one of the most fundamental choices in the development of an ocean model. In this paper, we investigate several time integration schemes when applied to the shallow water equations. This set of equations is accurate enough for the modeling of a shallow ocean and is also relevant to study as it is the one solved for the barotropic (i.e. vertically averaged) component of a three dimensional ocean model. We analyze different time stepping algorithms for the linearized shallow water equations. High order explicit schemes are accurate but the time step is constrained by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. Implicit schemes can be unconditionally stable but, in practice lack accuracy when used with large time steps. In this paper we propose a detailed comparison of such classical schemes with exponential integrators. The accuracy and the computational costs are analyzed in different configurations.},
